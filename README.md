# Quick_QR_Generator

Quick QR Generator project that generates QRs from texts, and supports multi page printing and formatting of QR codes. QR sources can be read from a folder of multiple source text files.

Useful if you want to format and create grids of QR codes that you want to print out.

Check the ./Assets/[Assets]/Sample_Input_File.txt as sample input. You can have as many of these files as you want, with arbitrary numbers of codes, and the app will help you print them all out, space them out, skip some, leave empty spaces in the grid etc.

Output: image(s), representing sheet(s) of paper, e.g. A4, with qr codes on it of custom size and arrangement.
